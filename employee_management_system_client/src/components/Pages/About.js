                           <p>Employee administration that uses coaching to motivate and build trust with workers can unlock enormous human potential.

                           <p>Employee administration is the process by which employers ensure workers perform their jobs to the best of their abilities so as to achieve business goals. It typically entails building and maintaining healthy relationships with employees, as well as monitoring their daily labor and measuring progress. In this way, employers can identify opportunities for improvement and recognize achievements.</p>
